						Sometimes you have to make a decision between working on a project, or writing a blog entry about a project.
						For the last few days, I've been working on projects, but I haven't been updating this blog, so I thought I
						should give you an update right now.
						
						Here's my finished <a href=https://abelmaniquis.github.io/quiz_app/index.html>Batman Quiz app</a>, which you can
						use to test your Batman Knowledge. I've also been working on a <a href="https://abelmaniquis.github.io/youtube_search/index.html">youtube search app</a>,
						which uses the Youtube API to search for the top 5 most popular videos under a certain search term.
						As of today, I haven't made the apps responsive yet, my plan is to finish all of the projects in the curriculum first, and then go back
						to add more features, make them more responsive, and just make them look better in general.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I haven't been programming, I've been reading <i>Eloquent Javascript</i> by Marijn Haverbeke. I've been mostly using
						it as a reference, or reading a chapter before I go to sleep. The goal for the next couple of months is to eat sleep and
						breathe Javascript until I find a job, at which point I can switch to simply just eating and breathing Javascript.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						That's the thing about this program. It's easy to start thinking about this as a 3-6 month process, but it really
						is the beginning of a true lifestyle change. The learning certainly will not stop when the program
						ends. One of my favorite aspects about the field of Computer Science is that there's so many different
						resources out there for anyone who wants to learn or improve their skills. There are communities of programmers out there,
						online tutorials, and even free college courses through MOOCs. Anybody can start learning.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I guess that's all I have to say right now. Its time to make another Git commit. Hopefully, I'll be able to update this faster
						next time.

				<h2 class="title">Dear Rubber Duck</h2>
				<p class="meta"><span class="date">May 2, 2016</span><span class="posted"> Posted by: <a href="#">Abel Maniquis</a></span></p>

						Today begins the first of many similar entries that will serve as the meat and bones of this blog.
						I'll be tracking my progress on the projects that I am working on, and explain my thought process while working
						through said projects. Hopefully, by explaining my reasoning here to you, the reader, it will help my own
						understanding. In order to explain a topic to somebody else, you have to be able to explain it to yourself first.
						I'll also be posting code snippets here as well (which will help with my HTML skills). Sometimes when writing a program,
						as with writing an essay or a novel, it's easy to find one's self drifting off and just doing things with no foresight or
						logic. I hope to remedy that behavior in myself through this blog.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						The industry has a term for this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber Duck Debugging</a>. So
						I bestow upon you reader, the title of Rubber Duck. Congratulations.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						This post's project is a quiz app. I'm supposed to build a program that asks 5 or more multiple choice questions to the
						user. The quiz topic can be anything I choose. The program is supposed to tell the user whether or not they are incorrect,
						it's then supposed to track the user's answers and output a final score. It's a simple app, but underneath the hood, it's
						powered by many important concepts in Javascript, in particular, objects and functions.
					</p>
					
					
					<p>
						While the curriculum wants me to wireframe what the app will look like, I prefer to start with figuring out the Javascript
						logic first.
					</p>
					
					<p>To start off, this: </p>
					<xmp>
		var question1 = {statement: 'According to Batman Vol.1 #673, 
				how long did Bruce Wayne train with "Ninja shadow masters" in the far east?',
        			choices:["one year","two years","five years","eight years"],
        			answer: 1};
					</xmp>
					
					<p>
						This will be the format of a multiple choice question. I figure that each question has three elements:
						<ol>
							<li>A statement of the question expressed as a string</li>
							<li>A list of potential items expressed as an array</li>
							<li>An index for the correct answer, expressed as an integer, or an index to the array.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Also, you might notice that I have chosen to make the quiz about Batman. I was originally intending to brush up on my math skills
						by asking 5 word problems involving Bernoulli trials, as these problems are easily convertible to word problems. Then I realized that
						it probably wasn't a good idea to be juggling around statistics on top of the Javascript that I already have to figure out, so I decided
						to put this Batman trivia book that I have lying around to good use.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						So I have five of these questions lined up, and have written the following function:
					</p>
					
						<xmp>
			function feedback(input,question){
    			if(question.choices[input] === question.choices[question.answer]){
        		return "correct";
    			}
    			else{
        		return "incorrect";
    			}
			};
						</xmp>
					<p>
						However, using (question.choices[input] === question.choices[question.answer]) is redundant. I can shorten the 
						statement to (input === question.answer)
					</p>
					
					
					<p>
					Here's the code that I have so far, I haven't applied jQuery to it yet, so the best I can do is console log the questions and
					statements and see if the correct output is returned, which is what is happening.
					</p>
					
					<xmp>
						       var question1 = {statement: 'According to Batman Vol.1 #673, how long did Bruce Wayne train with "Ninja shadow masters" in the far east?',
        choices: ["one year","two years","five years","eight years"],
        answer: 1};
        
        var question2 ={statement: 'Dick Grayson chose "Robin as his first superhero alias. What was the original reason for this?"',
          choices: ["His mother nicknamed him Robin since he once leaped through the air to save his brother","He intended to emulate Robin Hood","It was his nickname when  he was performing with the circus.","His mother nicknamed him Robin because he was born in the first day of Spring"],
          answer: 1};
         
        var question3 = {statement: "In Batman: The Animated Series, who became the Clock King?",
            choices: ["Temple Fugate","Templeton Fugit", "William Tockman", "Victor Zasz"],
            answer: 0};
            
        var question4 = {statement: "Wayne Manor is generally thought to be how far outside of Gotham City?",
            choices: ["5 miles","8 miles","12 miles","20 miles","23 miles"],
            answer: 2}
        
        var question5 = {statement:'Which anthology contains a Batman Story by Isaac Asimov, who has been called the "grandfather of science fiction"?',
            choices:["Tales of the Batman","The Adventures of the Batman","The Further Adventures of Batman, Vol 3","Legends of the Batman"],
            answer: 0}
        
        var questionarray = [question1,question2,question3,question4,question5];


function feedback(input,question){
    if(question.choices[input] === question.choices[question.answer]){
        return "correct";
    }
    else{
        return "incorrect";
    }
};


function feedback2(input,question){
    if(input === question.answer){
        return "correct";
    }
    else{
        return "incorrect";
    }
};

				<h2 class="title">Sunday Reflection: Financial Technologies</h2>
				<p class="meta"><span class="date">May 1, 2016</span><span class="posted"> Posted by: <a href="#">Abel Maniquis</a></span></p>
				<div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>

					<p>
						Tonight, 60 minutes aired a story about new Financial Apps that are set to disrupt the banking industry. The story was very relevant
						to my interests and my experiences. In 2011, I graduated from UC San Diego with a Bachelor's degree in economics, and in the ensuing job
						hunt, quickly discovered that, despite being educated at an institution known for its science and technology programs, I had been woefully
						unprepared for an economy that was slowly becoming increasingly technology driven.
					</p>
					<p>
						I applied to many places, banks mostly. And found myself competing with upwards of a couple dozen people for a single bank teller position,
						among the applicants were MBAs and various others with a lot of experience in the world of finance and sales. Charisma and sales ability are not exactly
						my specialty, but I am still interested in markets and how they function.
					</p>
					<p>
						The 60 Minutes story covered Stripe, a mobile app that allows people and companies to make payments directy over their phone. They provide
						an API on <a href="https://stripe.com/">their website,</a> which I'll take the time to explore later. It looks like the API allows you to design
						customized payment forms and, according to their site, allows the collection of credit card and bank account details without touching the server.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am currently in the second half of Thinkful's Front End Web Development course, and at the end of this section, you have to complete an API project. I'll be looking
						at Stripe a little more closely for this project.

						Today is Saturday, which means it's time for networking at the <a href="http://ansirsd.com/">Ansir Innovation Center</a>.
						The Ansir Innovation Center is a startup hub dedicated to providing an office environment to San Diego startups. They also hold
						various events and opportunities for networking.
					</p>
					<p>
						Networking is the most effective tool in a job hunt, and one that I haven't been able to utilize effectively in past job searches.
						I'm hoping that getting to know other programmers in the San Diego region will open up more opportunities.
					</p>
					<p>However, being that it is the weekend. I think I should spend some time talking about some fun things. In particular, some thoughts
					   that I have about a particular movie that I haven't seen. I love watching movies, and once things are a little more settled I'll be
					   giving more thoughts and opinions on different movies on this blog. I am particularly interested in the business of movies and storytelling
					   in general, especially when it comes to large blockbuster franchises, Which is why I want to talk about Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice,
					   which currently has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 27%.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, I still haven't seen this movie for two reasons: a constrained budget and a sense of principle. According to a quick google search,
						this movie cost 250 million dollars to make, and has made 852 million dollars, which means that despite its poor reviews, the Studio(Warner Brothers)
						has no particular incentive to change direction and try to make better films. If a company comes out with a bad product, you don't buy it. So unless I
						can find a way to see it for free, I will not be watching Batman V Superman anytime in the near future. However, I am looking forward to Captain America: Civil War.

						As a final note, this page is still under construction, and at the moment, still being hosted on Github.

					<p>Hello. Welcome to my blog. This first post will be posted whenever I get the css to my liking. Before I continue. 
					The original inspiration for this blog's design is from <a href="http://templated.co/keyboard">templated's keyboard template.</a>
					I figured that creating a blog would be the perfect way to practice my design fundamentals. Yes, no wordpress for me, 
					I plan on building this thing with pure HTML/CSS. That way, all the stuff on it belongs to me.</p>
					<p>I will be hosting this site on Github Pages until the site gets big enough for me to justify having my own url. For the moment it's going to be me blogging my thoughts.</p>
