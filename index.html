						Today is Saturday, which means it's time for networking at the <a href="http://ansirsd.com/">Ansir Innovation Center</a>.
						The Ansir Innovation Center is a startup hub dedicated to providing an office environment to San Diego startups. They also hold
						various events and opportunities for networking.
					</p>
					<p>
						Networking is the most effective tool in a job hunt, and one that I haven't been able to utilize effectively in past job searches.
						I'm hoping that getting to know other programmers in the San Diego region will open up more opportunities.
					</p>
					<p>However, being that it is the weekend. I think I should spend some time talking about some fun things. In particular, some thoughts
					   that I have about a particular movie that I haven't seen. I love watching movies, and once things are a little more settled I'll be
					   giving more thoughts and opinions on different movies on this blog. I am particularly interested in the business of movies and storytelling
					   in general, especially when it comes to large blockbuster franchises, Which is why I want to talk about Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice,
					   which currently has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 27%.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, I still haven't seen this movie for two reasons: a constrained budget and a sense of principle. According to a quick google search,
						this movie cost 250 million dollars to make, and has made 852 million dollars, which means that despite its poor reviews, the Studio(Warner Brothers)
						has no particular incentive to change direction and try to make better films. If a company comes out with a bad product, you don't buy it. So unless I
						can find a way to see it for free, I will not be watching Batman V Superman anytime in the near future. However, I am looking forward to Captain America: Civil War.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						As a final note, this page is still under construction, and at the moment, still being hosted on Github.

					<p>Hello. Welcome to my blog. This first post will be posted whenever I get the css to my liking. Before I continue. 
					The original inspiration for this blog's design is from <a href="http://templated.co/keyboard">templated's keyboard template.</a>
					I figured that creating a blog would be the perfect way to practice my design fundamentals. Yes, no wordpress for me, 
					I plan on building this thing with pure HTML/CSS. That way, all the stuff on it belongs to me.</p>
					<p>I will be hosting this site on Github Pages until the site gets big enough for me to justify having my own url. For the moment it's going to be me blogging my thoughts.</p>
